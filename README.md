## To clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/spausanc/ASTR-136-Twilight-Sky.git
```

## To create your own branch
Make sure you change branchname to the name of your branch.
After this you'll be in your own branch, and the changes you make won't affect others.
But they will have the ability to see those changes.
```
cd ASTR-136-Twilight-Sky
git branch branchname
git checkout branchname
```


## To start tracking a new file
1. Drag the file into the git folder
2. In your terminal (in your own branch)type:

```
git add filename
git commit -m "message explaining the file or the changes"
git push
```

## To push changes to the remote repository so other people can see it

```
git add filename (where filename is the file that you changed)
git commit -m "message"
git push
```
